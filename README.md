# :christmas_tree: Ho-ho-holiday
A team project/challenge given to us by [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg) right before the Christmas holiday. We created a website with 4 games to enjoy during the holidays. We decided to go for a retro/space look and feel. Each of our team members recreated a game and the rest of the project is a team effort. We had one week to complete this project and present it to other teams. Future improvements will follow. We've got to keep practicing and improving!
